<context> # Overview Hybrid Graph RAG is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that combines graph-based knowledge traversal with traditional vector-based similarity search. It is designed to improve retrieval precision, contextual coherence, and semantic linkage in large knowledge bases, such as Obsidian vaults or enterprise document graphs. By leveraging structured relationships (e.g., backlinks, tags, and paths) and enriching LLM inputs with contextual graph neighborhoods, this system allows for more accurate, explainable, and dynamic information retrieval. This solution is ideal for researchers, engineers, PKM practitioners, and internal AI agents needing grounded, semantically linked context for question answering and task generation.
Core Features
True Graph Construction
What it does: Builds a comprehensive knowledge graph with node relationships including backlinks, tags, metadata, and recency.

Why it's important: Enables semantic graph traversal and structurally coherent document discovery.

How it works: Parses documents and metadata, builds directed/weighted graph with node enrichment using frontmatter, timestamps, and tags.

Graph-Based Retriever
What it does: Traverses the graph via k-hop expansion, tag/cluster relationships, and path-based queries.

Why it's important: Finds documents based on structural proximity and semantic relationship, not just lexical similarity.

How it works: Starts from a seed node (e.g., via keyword match or vector entry), then expands to neighbors using configurable traversal logic.

Hybrid Retriever
What it does: Combines graph traversal results with vector similarity re-ranking.

Why it's important: Balances high-recall semantic search with high-precision structured retrieval.

How it works: Generates a candidate document set using graph traversal, then re-ranks via vector similarity using a tunable scoring function.

Graph-Aware Context Formatting
What it does: Structures the retrieved context for LLM input, maintaining relational clarity (e.g., parent, child, sibling nodes).

Why it's important: Enables the LLM to reason over relationships, not just raw text.

How it works: Templates for different edge types (e.g., “linked via”, “tagged with”, “recently updated”) wrap the context in a relational narrative.

RAG Pipeline Integration
What it does: Seamlessly integrates graph retrieval into an existing RAG query interface.

Why it's important: Ensures backward compatibility and future extensibility.

How it works: The RAGPipeline.query() method accepts graph-specific parameters and falls back to vector retrieval as needed.

User Experience
User Personas
Knowledge workers using Obsidian-style PKM systems for synthesis and recall

AI agents generating answers from internal wikis or documentation graphs

Researchers needing traceable, context-aware sources for deep queries

Key User Flows
Input natural language query → Candidate documents selected via hybrid retriever → Graph context formatted and sent to LLM → Answer generated with traceable source paths

UI/UX Considerations
Show retrieval provenance (graph path, edge types)

Toggle between graph-only, vector-only, and hybrid modes

Allow traversal parameter tuning (depth, weights, recency bias)

Optional: interactive graph visualization of context neighborhood

Risks and Mitigations
Technical
Risk: Graph retrieval adds latency
Mitigation: Precompute traversals or cache results

Risk: Poor context formatting reduces LLM accuracy
Mitigation: Iterative template testing + prompt engineering

MVP Scope
Risk: Overbuild with unused graph features
Mitigation: Start with backlinks + tags only, expand later

Resource Constraints
Risk: Dataset or domain mismatch
Mitigation: Use synthetic Obsidian vaults or real markdown data for test coverage
