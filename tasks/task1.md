Task 1: Review Existing Codebase and Documentation
I've examined the key components of the project:
RAG Pipeline Architecture:
The system uses a hybrid RAG approach combining semantic search (vector embeddings) with symbolic search (tags, links, dates)
The core functionality is in backend/rag_pipeline.py which handles document indexing, query processing, and response generation
FAISS is used as the vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings
OpenAI embeddings are used for semantic search
Backend API:
FastAPI powers the backend in backend/main.py
Endpoints include: /query, /index, /health, /themes, and /reflect
The API already has CORS configured to allow requests from chat.openai.com
Plugin Structure:
Basic ChatGPT plugin files exist in the plugin/ directory
ai-plugin.json contains metadata but needs updates
openapi.yaml defines the API specification but may need enhancement
Conversation Memory:
backend/conversation_memory.py handles storing and retrieving conversation history
It will need enhancements to work well with ChatGPT's conversation model
Integration Points:
The main integration point will be enhancing the backend API to better support ChatGPT plugin requirements
We'll need to update the OpenAPI specification and plugin manifest
The conversation memory system will need to be enhanced for ChatGPT compatibility
Data Flow:
User queries from ChatGPT → Plugin API → RAG Pipeline → Obsidian Vault data → Response generation → ChatGPT display
Conversation context is maintained across interactions
